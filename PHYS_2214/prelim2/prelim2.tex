\section{Dispersion}
Recall that in our discussion of ideal waves, we assumed a constant wave
velocity for a given medium that was invariant of the wave's shape or speed.
This simplifying assumption does not hold in real life. Instead, wave velocity
is a function of a wave's frequency, $\omega$, and wave vector, $k$.
\begin{equation}
\cbox{%
  v = \frac{\omega}{k}
}
\end{equation}

More precisely, we define the \emph{phase velocity}, $v_p$, and \emph{group
velocity}, $v_g$.
\begin{gather}
  \cbox{v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}} \\
  \cbox{v_g = \left. \frac{d\omega}{dk} \right|_{\omega, k}}
\end{gather}

If we consider a graph of $\omega$ and $k$ parametrized on $v$, we can form a
graphical description of the phase and group velocity. The phase velocity of a
pair $(\omega, k)$ is the slope of the line segment connecting the origin to
the point $(\omega, k)$. The group velocity of a pair $(\omega, k)$ is the
slope of the line tangent to the curve at $(\omega, k)$.

\section{Beats}
Before we begin our analysis of beats, recall a trigonometric identity.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:beats-trig}
\cbox[blue]{%
  \cos(a) + \cos(b) = 2 \left[ 
    \cos\group{\frac{a+b}{2}} \cos\group{\frac{a-b}{2}} 
  \right]
}
\end{equation}

Now, consider two waves propagating in the same medium in the same direction.
\begin{align*}
  y_1 &= A \cos(k_1 x - \omega_1 t) \\
  y_2 &= A \cos(k_2 x - \omega_2 t)
\end{align*}

The superposition of the two waves is itself a wave.
\begin{align}
  y &= y_1 + y_2 \\
    &= \cbox{%
       2A \left[
        \cos\group{%
          \frac{\Delta k}{2}x - \frac{\Delta \omega}{2}t
        } 
        \cos\group{%
          \bar{k}x - \bar{\omega}t
        } 
      \right]
      }
\end{align}
\begin{equation}
  \Delta k = k_2 - k_1                         \quad 
  \Delta \omega = \omega_2 - \omega_1          \quad
  \bar{k} = \frac{k_1 + k_2}{2}                \quad
  \bar{\omega} = \frac{\omega_1 + \omega_2}{2} 
\end{equation}

If $\Delta k \ll k_1, k_2$, then the first sinusoid oscillates much slower than
the second and we get \emph{beats}, as shown in \figref{beats}. Notice that the
enveloping sinusoid has frequency $\frac{\Delta \omega}{2}$. However, the beat
frequency is half of the envelope's frequency. This is true because the beat is
maximally oscillating at both the peaks and valleys of the envelope.
\begin{equation}
  \omega_{\text{beat}} = \Delta \omega
\end{equation}

The beats are produced by the constructive and destructive interference, as
shown in \figref{beats-interference}.

\section{Doppler Effect}
\subsection{Mechanical Waves}
Consider a source $s$ and observer $o$. $s$ travels with velocity $v_s$. $o$
travels with velocity $v_o$. $s$ emits a wave with frequency $f_s$ and velocity
$v$. From this, we can determine the wave frequency perceived by $o$, denoted
$f_o$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:doppler}
\cbox{%
  f_0 = \frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s} f_s
}
\end{equation}

In equation~\eqref{eq:doppler}, $v_o$ and $v_s$ are positive when in the
direction of observer to source. However, there is an intuitive alternative to
memorizing this sign convention. Remember that $v_o$ appears in the numerator,
and remember that $v_s$ appears in the denominator. When thinking about the
velocity of a source or observer, ask yourself what effect their motion would
have on the observed frequency. Should the motion increase or decrease the
observed frequency? Based on this intuition, the sign of the velocity follows
naturally.

For example, consider a source moving away from the observer. If a source is
moving away, then the wave he emits will appear to have a lower frequency than
$f_s$. Thus, the observed frequency will decrease. Because $v_s$ appears in the
denominator of Equation~\eqref{eq:doppler}, $v_s$ must be positive to decrease
the value of $f_o$.

A few notes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $v_o$ and $v_s$ are measured with respect to the medium in which the
    wave propagates.
  \item $v$ is always positive.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Electromagnetic Waves}
TODO: There's some controversy on sign convention and a possible typo in the
lecture notes.
