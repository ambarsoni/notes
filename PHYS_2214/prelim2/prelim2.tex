\section{Dispersion}
Recall that in our discussion of ideal waves, we assumed a constant wave velocity for a given medium that was invariant of the wave's shape or speed. This simplifying assumption does not hold in real life. Instead, wave velocity is a function of a wave's frequency, $\omega$, and wave vector, $k$.
\[\cbox{
  v = \frac{\omega}{k}
}\]

More precisely, we define the \emph{phase velocity}, $v_p$, and \emph{group velocity}, $v_g$.
\begin{gather}
  \cbox{v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}} \\
  \cbox{v_g = \left. \frac{d\omega}{dk} \right|_{\omega, k}}
\end{gather}

If we consider a graph of $\omega$ and $k$ parametrized on $v$, as shown in \figref{TODO} and \figref{TODO}, we can form a graphical description of the phase and group velocity. The phase velocity of a pair $(\omega, k)$ is the slope of the line segment connecting the origin to the point $(\omega, k)$. The group velocity of a pair $(\omega, k)$ is the slope of the line tangent to the curve at $(\omega, k)$.
